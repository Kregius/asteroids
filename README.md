This is my first game project. I hope it works.
It is relying on pygame 2.6.1 and venv

Controls:

After the game is run in venv a screen will open:
w : makes ship(triangle) move forward
s : makes ship go backwards
a : rotates ship to the left
d : rotates ship to the right
SPACE : ship shoots bullets that destroy(or split) asteroids

Game Over:

Game ends when ship colides with an asteroid
